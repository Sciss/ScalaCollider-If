# ScalaCollider-If

A set of additional graph elements for [ScalaCollider](https://github.com/Sciss/ScalaCollider),
allowing the nesting of a graph in a resource efficient manner, by pausing the inactive branches.
This is facilitated by a new nested UGen graph builder that, unlike the standard builder, creates
an entire tree of UGen graphs to which the conditional branches are decomposed.

## examples

A "side-effecting" block does not produce a dedicated return signal
but is used for UGens that have side effects. For example:

```scala
// ---- Unit result ----

If (freq > 100) Then {
  Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar(freq))
}

If (freq > 100) Then {
  Out.ar(0, SinOsc.ar(freq))
} Else {
  freq.poll(0, "freq")
}
```

A block where each case evaluates to a sub-type of `GE` produces
a dedicated return signal that can then be further processed.
For example:

```scala
// ---- GE result ----

val res: GE = If (freq > 100) Then {
  SinOsc.ar(freq)
} Else {
  WhiteNoise.ar
}
Out.ar(0, res)

val res: GE = If (freq > 1000) Then {
  SinOsc.ar(freq)
} ElseIf (freq > 100) Then {
  Dust.ar(freq)
} Else {
  WhiteNoise.ar
}
Out.ar(0, res * 0.5)
```

If a branch refers to UGens from the outer scope, for example the
`freq` element in `SinOsc.ar(freq)`, the UGen graph builder automatically
inserts link buses. Recursive nesting of if-then-else blocks is also
supported.

Classes are placed in the conventional `de.sciss.synth` package,
matching with the other types and UGens of ScalaCollider.

## limitations

- currently, `ControlProxy` elements do not properly propagate from
  outer to inner scope.
- the number of cases per if-block is limited to 24
- while the compound result signal from an if-block uses the
  maximum of the number of channels used by each individual case,
  the signals of the cases are not "wrap-expanded" as in regular
  multi-channel-expansion. The user should thus ensure that all
  branches produce signals of the same number of channels.
